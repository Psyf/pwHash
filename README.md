# pwHash
A python-based CLI tool for hashing strings

**Tested and Created on:** 
  * Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (x64) 

**Steps to get this CLI tool working:** 
  1. Make sure you have python 3.x and pip installed. 
  2. Clone the repository. 
  3. In your terminal type `chmod +x install.sh`. This will make the bash script executable. 
  4. In your terminal type `./install.sh`. This will run pip and the dependencies will be automatically installed. 
  5. If all goes well, you can type into your terminal `pwHash [stringToHash] [algorithmToUse]` and it'll blurt out the hash. Type a random string in place of `[algorithmToUse]` to find out all the available hashing algorithms on your system.
